#Project - 1

-Data was scraped from the GitHub API by filtering users in Tokyo,Japan with over 200 followers and fetching their most recent repositories.

-Majority of the repositories from Tokyo are written in JavaScript but surprisingly Rust is seen in many repositories, mainly newer users. Also, Assembly happens to be the language with highest average stars per repository. Surprising!!!

-Developers in Tokyo should focus on collaboration in JavaScript-based and Rust-based projects to leverage the local expertise and community.
